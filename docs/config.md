# Configuration

WebChunk uses JSON for configuration file.\
WebChunk will likely (partially) shut down or panic if configuration is incorrect (likely on startup).\
Configuration tree is populated with default values if values are not found, it allows
starting of WebChunk without config file and later creation/saving defaulted configuration.\
Path to load config from is taken from environment variable `WEBCHUNK_CONFIG` and defaults to `config.json` if empty.

| `cache_path` | string | Yes | `imageCache` | Path to where cached images should be stored |
| `max_memory_image_cache` | int | No | `512` | Number of images to cache (each image is 512x512 taking a bit more than 1 megabyte of memory) |
| `web` | object | Parially | see below | Group for web-related parameters |

| `proxy`.`online_mode` | bool | No | `true` | Same as online-mode on regular Minecraft servers |
| `proxy`.`compress_threshold` | int | No | `-1` | Threshold set the smallest size of raw network payload to compress. Set to 0 to compress all packets. Set to -1 to disable compression. |

### Storage object

Storage object contains 2 fields: `type` and `address`.

Storage types:

- `postgres` PostgreSQL database, address is a URI or DSN connection string to the database
- `filesystem` Mojang-compatible anvil region format storage, address is a path to the directory (will not be created automatically)

Example of storage objects:

```json
{
    "storages": {
        "default": {
            "type": "filesystem",
            "address": "./storages/defalt"
        },
        "database": {
            "type": "postgres",
            "address": "host=localhost dbname=chunkdb user=webchunk password=chunky81254 port=9182 connect_timeout=3"
        }
    }
}
```
